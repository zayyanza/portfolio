        <p>Hi! I’m a Full Stack Web Developer from Indonesia with a strong passion for building modern and efficient web applications. I mainly focus on React for front-end development and Laravel for back-end solutions, creating seamless and user-friendly experiences. I’m a naturally curious person who loves technologies and improving my skills every day. Currently, I’m pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, while actively working on programming projects that allow me to grow as a developer. I'm also friendly✌️.</p>
